# Shoal

*With so many fish in the sea,<br />
Which one is right for me?*

Shoal is how you date so you make the right decisions

#### Add dating profiles
Add profiles of the people you're dating so you'll never worry about forgetting the name of that Nordic tv series they're watching right now.

#### Reflect on your dates
Have the opportunity to properly reflect on dates by writing down your thoughts. Any red flags? Green flags?

#### Move profiles to the past
Not feeling the vibe? They talked about bitcoin one too many times? Move a profile to the past if you're not interested in seeing them again

#### Get insights on your dating
Got lots of nibbles but no good catches? See patterns and trends in who you're dating and get data-based insights on your dates.

## About

This is my first full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) app. It follows RESTful conventions and adheres to the MVC file structure (Models, Views, Controllers).
